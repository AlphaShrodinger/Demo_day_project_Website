# Dungeon of Stone Website

## What is this website for?

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website was designed for mostly estetic and an access source for a videogame i developed with Louis Martines called Dungeons of Stone. You can find more about the game on either the website itself or in the project repository of the game <a href="https://github.com/LouisTenebrae/Demo_day_project_Game" target="_blank">Dungeons of Stone.</a> </p>

## How was the Website developed

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The website in itself was centered around the game, as it is a complementary page, It has information about the game, a download link as well as section where you can read a summarizeed version as how the game was created.</p>

The website was designed using basic structures and programing languages such as:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**


<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website came to be as part of a project we had to develope in school, where we put our effort and inspiration to work on the best of our abilities at the time. The game was co-developed by me and my parter Louis Martines, however the website was mostly my creation wich some of my colleages imput. HTML was used for the content of the website in itself, such as information and images, CSS for decoration, placement and appearances of the same, and JavaScript was used to add a dark mode function on the website for a little extra. The webpage was uploaded using Github Pages and you can view it completely from this <a href="https://alphashrodinger.github.io/Demo_day_project_Website/" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
