            <h3>Step 1: Design</h3>

            <p>We began our journey of designing the game's visuals, layout, and overall aesthetics with simple sketches
                in a notebook. At first, it was all about getting our thoughts down on paper—rough outlines, concepts,
                and ideas. We used this initial stage as a foundation to explore different possibilities, refining the
                style and feel of the game over time. Slowly, we translated these rough ideas into digital designs,
                bringing each concept to life bit by bit. With every step, we saw our vision come together, evolving
                from abstract thoughts into something tangible that truly reflected the essence of the game.</p>

                <p class="text">After finalizing the design of our game, we transitioned into the development phase. We
                    chose Godot as
                    our game engine, which provided the flexibility and tools we needed to bring our ideas to life. The
                    first task was to develop the basic game mechanics and logic. We started simple, focusing on
                    movement.
                    We programmed a basic background and created a platform for the character to stand on. From there,
                    we
                    implemented movement mechanics, allowing the character to move left and right across the screen. To
                    add
                    some complexity, we also coded a double jump feature, marking the first steps toward building out
                    the
                    core gameplay.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Basics</h3>

            <div class="movement">

                <p class="text">
                    After completing the initial development phase, we decided to create a test environment to explore
                    more
                    of Godot’s functionality. This area served as a controlled testing ground where we could experiment
                    with
                    core elements like collision shapes, camera movement, and basic map design. Establishing this
                    environment allowed us to iteratively develop and refine essential gameplay mechanics. By using this
                    test area, we could systematically implement and evaluate various features that would be integral to
                    the
                    final game, ensuring a solid foundation before advancing further in the project.

                <p class="text">
                    Once we completed programming the foundational mechanics—such as movement and collision detection—we
                    began laying the groundwork for designing distinct zones within the game map. We structured the map
                    around four unique levels, each designed with different sprites and visual themes to create a clear
                    sense of distinction between areas. Within each zone, we integrated platforming elements to enhance
                    gameplay, ensuring that each level offered a unique experience and progressively challenging
                    layouts. This approach allowed us to establish a diverse, engaging world that supports the overall
                    gameplay flow and aesthetic vision.

            <h3>Step 5: Enemy Developing</h3>

                <img src="images/slime.png" alt="Basic tutorial pic" class="imageL">

                <p class="text">
                    After completing the overall map design, we shifted our focus to implementing combat mechanics to
                    enhance gameplay depth. Our initial approach involved introducing the game’s first enemy type:
                    slimes. We created two variants, a standard slime and a larger, more challenging big slime. These
                    enemies were strategically distributed throughout the map to introduce balanced combat encounters
                    and increase the game’s difficulty. This addition not only added an element of challenge but also
                    enriched the gameplay experience, encouraging players to engage actively with the environment and
                    test their skills against varied adversaries.

            <h3>Step 6: Final Touches</h3>

            <p>
                With these core mechanics in place, our game reached a fully playable state. From this point, it became
                a process of refining and iterating until we achieved a level of polish that met our vision. By reusing
                and adapting the existing enemy code, we laid a flexible foundation for adding future enemy types
                efficiently. Looking ahead, we plan to implement a leveling system to introduce progression elements,
                allowing players to further engage with the game’s mechanics. While there is always room for future
                enhancements, we’re pleased with the current state of the game and the cohesive experience we have
                created.
